# Spring_Project1

A simple virtual library implementation. It is based on Spring Boot and built with Intellij IDEA.

### About

With the advent of technology, the work of librarians seems less efficient. So let's create a special service for that! Using Spring, I showed how the library works: we add/remove people to the list of readers, we add/remove books from the library list, we assign books to readers or release them.

Keep your voice down, you're in a library!:)
